# Basketball Stat Tracker Project 2
The name says it all. This is our second group project for our coding bootcamp and we went with a basketball stat tracker. The point of our application is for a manager of a basketball team to have a application where they can add all the stats they want for their team members amnd their games. There are individual team stats where the manager can add things like, how many points, rebounds, assists, steals, turnovers, blocks, and personal fouls one of the team member has. The manager can also add and delete players from the roaster and on annother page the manager can add the descriptions of each player on the team like where they went to school, thier postion, They can also look at previous games and see the score, who they played and more.
